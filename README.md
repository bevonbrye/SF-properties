# San Francisco Properties:
- San Francisco has some of the world's most beautiful properties. These properties are often a motivation for me to get better at my craft (potentially own one someday), which propelled me to create this stock SF-properties web application. I also wanted to exemplify and heavily focus on React with styled-components to ensure that I knew exactly how to implement this front-end technique to strengthen my design skills!
